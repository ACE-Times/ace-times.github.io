# Hey guys! 

In case you didn't read the title, it's time to start making **leprechaun traps!** :four_leaf_clover:

People can display them from the beginning of March until the contest on March 20th. :calendar: :shamrock:

Every participant will win points for their house team. :medal_sports:

On the final week, students will vote on which one was their favorite and the winner will receive a **crown**! :crown:

If you need ideas, check out the images below or look it up:
