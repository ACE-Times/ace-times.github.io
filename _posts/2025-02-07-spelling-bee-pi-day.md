This is going to be very exciting, because the schoolwide **Spelling Bee** is on the same day we're celebrating **Pi Day**! :grinning:

Just for clarification, this will _not_ be on March 14, since that is not a school day. It will be the day before.

<h1 style="text-align: center">Spelling Bee :bee:</h1>

How this is going to work is the classroom spelling bees will be held on March 13. The winners of each one will then get a spot in the entire school's Spelling Bee.

First, second, and third place will win a prize! :1st_place_medal: :2nd_place_medal: :3rd_place_medal:

<h1 style="text-align: center">Pi Day :pie:</h1>

Rhetoric students and staff will be pie-faced by kids at the same schoolwide assembly as the Spelling Bee on March 13.

Students may buy raffle tickets for $1.00 each in order to have a chance at being called up to yeet a pie at someone's face.
