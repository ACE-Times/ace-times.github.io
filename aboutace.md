The Academy for Character Education (ACE) is a tuition-free public charter school located in Cottage Grove, Oregon. ACE is committed to helping parents provide their children with the best education possible by applying [the four pillars for learning](https://www.aceclassicaled.org/four-pillars): focusing on building strong character, working as a team with parents, ensuring that your child is appropriately placed, and utilizing the time-tested [classical method](https://www.aceclassicaled.org/classical-education). Students may attend ACE even if the school is not in their district.

ACE is a charter school within the [South Lane School District](https://www.slane.k12.or.us/), and all ACE students are members of the student body of SLSD, regardless of the districts where they reside. SLSD allocates some operating funds to ACE, including enrichment support through [Student Investment Account programs](https://www.aceclassicaled.org/_files/ugd/fe6999_1b8fa7be50a8477e81fe7334b0e7c703.pdf), a component of the 2019 Oregon [Student Success Act](https://www.oregon.gov/ode/studentsuccess/Pages/default.aspx).
