<h1 style="text-align: center;">Hey There!</h1>

If you managed to make it through the other about page, then this one will be a breeze! :grin:

My name is **Hudson Sahnow**, but some of you might know me as **TAC0CAT9779**.

You can view my [**Github profile**](https://github.com/tac0cat9779) if you're into that kind of thing (coding). I'm also on [**Scratch**](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/TACOCAT9779/), but I don't really use it anymore... :neutral_face:

So yeah, that's pretty much it. Hope you like this website! :slightly_smiling_face:
