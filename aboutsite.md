This is basically just a combination of a newspaper and a blog, since we couldn't decide between the two! :grin:

It's mostly a blog though. :slightly_smiling_face:

Even though it might _seem_ super formal with the fonts and such, it's just a **fancy-looking blog**. :upside_down_face:

It's gonna have announcements about **upcoming school events** and stuff like that. :loudspeaker:

I'm Hudson Sahnow by the way! Learn about me at [**About the Developer/Writer**](../aboutdev).

You can also learn more about ACE at the [**About ACE**](../aboutace) page on this website or the [**official ACE website**](https://www.aceclassicaled.org/).

Also, for those of you who don't know, **"The ACE Times"** is a play on **_The New York Times_**. :newspaper:

Hope you guys enjoy this! :smile:

P.S. If the thumbnail pictures look sad and gray, just hover over them. If I new how to change this setting, I would. :disappointed:
